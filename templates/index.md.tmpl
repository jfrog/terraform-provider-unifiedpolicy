# Unified Policy Provider

{{ .Description | trimspace }}

## Authentication

The Unified Policy provider supports several ways to authenticate:

### Access Token (Recommended)

The provider requires an Access Token to interact with the Unified Policy API.

```terraform
provider "unifiedpolicy" {
  url          = "https://myinstance.jfrog.io/artifactory"
  access_token = "my-access-token"
}
```

You can also use environment variables:

```bash
export JFROG_URL="https://myinstance.jfrog.io/artifactory"
export JFROG_ACCESS_TOKEN="my-access-token"
```

### API Key (Deprecated)

API keys are deprecated but still supported for backward compatibility.

```terraform
provider "unifiedpolicy" {
  url     = "https://myinstance.jfrog.io/artifactory"
  api_key = "my-api-key"
}
```

## Requirements

- Artifactory 7.125.0 or later
- Xray 3.130.5 or later
- Enterprise Plus license with AppTrust entitlements
- Terraform 1.0 or later

## Unified Policy API Endpoints

This provider uses the JFrog Unified Policy API (`/unifiedpolicy/api/v1/policies`) to manage lifecycle policies. Lifecycle policies define the rules and enforcement actions that apply to applications at specific stages of the software development lifecycle (SDLC).

### Lifecycle Policy Management

Lifecycle policies are governance controls that define:
- **Conditions** to check (e.g., CVEs, licenses, evidence requirements)
- **Actions** to take when conditions are met (e.g., `block` to fail promotion, `warning` to allow with violation)
- **Scope** (project-level or application-level)
- **Lifecycle gates** (entry, exit, release) at specific stages
